Everything in this section works entirely on its own, with no Grocy (or any
other outside service) required. Grocy only adds the deeper grocery/recipe
features described in its own section below.
- **Meal planner** with 1–3 configurable blocks per day (Breakfast/Lunch/
  Dinner by default, renameable), an optional "breakfast on weekends only"
  toggle, per-dish custom card colors, and a drag-to-reorder **Edit** mode.
- **Meal view-card**: once a day's meal is actually set, opening it shows a
  clean read-only summary (dish name, Prep/Cook/Serves facts when known, a
  "View Recipe" button, and a small pencil button) instead of jumping
  straight back into the picker/edit fields. Tap the pencil to change the
  name, description, or link, or Clear to empty the slot again. The love/
  dislike rating buttons stay visible the whole time.
- **Recurring weekly meals**: any planned meal can be set to "repeat weekly":
  it then auto-fills the same weekday/block every future week until
  turned off or overridden for a single week (editing a projected occurrence
  asks whether to change just that day or every future week).
- **Whole-week meal templates**: save an entire week's plan as a named
  template ("Taco Tuesday week", "Camping week", etc.) and apply it to any
  week with one click.
- **Meal plan in Month view** (optional toggle): planned meals show as
  pills; tapping one opens that day's meal editor directly.
- **Recipe box ("Loved Dishes")** with heart/thumbs-down ratings, recipe
  links (with an **Open link** button next to the link field in the menu
  editor), and a picker to reuse a loved dish when planning a new meal.
  Dishes can be added, edited, and deleted from the Loved Dishes list and
  each dish's own detail screen.
- **Recipe Box card** (v1.110.6+): the same Recipe Box as its own dashboard
  tab/card (`family-hub-recipe-box-card.js`), for anyone who'd rather have it
  pinned open than pop it up from the calendar. Browse, search, filter by
  category, heart, suggest, and add/edit/delete dishes right there. It runs
  on the exact same underlying code as the calendar card's own Recipe Box
  modal, so a change to one always behaves identically on the other, and
  both read/write the same household-wide Recipe Box data.
- **Meal Suggestions**: there's no separate Suggestions box to manage;
  tapping the light-bulb icon on any Recipe Box entry (or checking "Also
  add to Meal Suggestions" while adding/editing one) flags it as a
  suggestion. Both the "💡 Meal Suggestion" option on the + button and the
  header's "💡 Suggestions" button open the Recipe Box itself, filtered to
  its "💡 Suggested" chip, so suggesting and picking a meal both happen in
  the same searchable list as everything else.
- **Search** inside the Recipe Box, including its Suggested filter.

Without Grocy, a Loved Dish or a day's meal is filled in through the dish/
day editor's own fields: name, description, a recipe link (with an Open
Link button), card color, servings, typed or pasted in by hand. The
three-way recipe importer described below (paste a link, paste raw recipe
text, or a blank form with per-ingredient matching) is a Grocy feature: it
always creates a real Grocy recipe, and needs a Grocy connection to work at
all.
